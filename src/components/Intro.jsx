            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering. My passion for technology has led me to develop a keen interest in both web development and machine learning. As a web developer, I have experience in creating responsive and user-friendly websites using various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and framework like ReactJS. I also have experience in developing back-end functionality using NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. In addition to web development, I have a strong inclination towards machine learning and its applications in various domains. I have completed courses in data science and machine learning, and have hands-on experience with Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn. I am interested in exploring the intersection of web development and machine learning, such as developing web applications that leverage machine learning algorithms.
